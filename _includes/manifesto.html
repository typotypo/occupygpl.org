        <h1>The Manifesto</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>The GPL is not a free license.</strong> It restricts freedoms to only people it deems to be morally acceptable.
            Often there are people who do not fall inside this morally acceptable box, yet they do really have good intentions. <br/>
            The <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a> (ironically) defines free software like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
            <li>
                The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing
                as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
            </li>
            <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor</li>
            <li>
                The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this
                you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to
                the source code is a precondition for this.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It's a really good one, but ironically the GPL doesn't conform this definition. Where does the GPL fail?
            <strong>
                4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can
                give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.
            </strong>
            Lets assume that there is a comapny that wants to use your open source library and integrate
            it into their proprietary program, they're even willing to improve your library and release the
            improvements to the publico so that the whole community benefits.<br/>
            Unfortunately, at the end of the day, the company needs to ship a product so it’d like to
            keep their core closed source. The GPL outlaws this kind of interaction. Our good citizen,
            a company wants to release their patches to your library back to the community and yet the
            GPL is banning them from doing so! It’s not giving them freedom at all! Instead, the GPL
            is a different set of restrictions. It may be that you personally find the set of restrictions
            that the GPL offers more morally palatable than traditional closed source licenses, but it is
            not a free license. It does not grant freedom, it grants different restrictions.
