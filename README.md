# occupygpl.org

For more permissive open source projects!

## Roadmap

* Translations (German, French, more...)
* Rewrite some text? I'm a programmer, not a writer :)
* Maybe a tool which checks if you have (L)GPL Github repos.

## Assets

Some Assets are made by the cool folks of [OccupyFlash.org](http://occupyflash.org).
